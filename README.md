# These Violent Delights UI theme

A pair of themes created as a fun side project to serve as a reminder to be careful what we wish for when programming for AI or automation. With a color theme based off of HBO's Westworld series - this UI theme is for the Atom text editor . This UI theme pairs with its Syntax theme "have-violent-ends-syntax" both themes are a work in progress.
